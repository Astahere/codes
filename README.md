## Usage

The game is based on one year period, so it consists of 52 weeks per round. In some weeks, we add in some surge demand period such as Christmas and Chinese New Year to enhance the reality and playability, so please be prepared in advance to satisfy customer demand. However, in the game, another challenge is to balnace the transportation cost and holding cost, so you have to consider carefully and decide order quantity, transportation method and when to place your order. The final goal of the game is to optimize the cash balance at week 53. You can see your rank in the "Leaderboard" Tab.
